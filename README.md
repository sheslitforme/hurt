basic open source nuke bot made by me, don't skid. i don't condone nuking, i just got bored enough to make this tool


how to use:

- make the basicenv file contain your bot token and make sure to add your token. replace the "your owner ids" in the main file and add your own.
- install python3.12 if you don't already have it.
- run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
- finally run ``python3 main.py`` if on Linux or ``python3.12 main.py`` if on Windows.

finally, i am not responsible for the outcomes of you using this tool, it's here for demostration purposes.
